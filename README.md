JAVALAB project task 4

A group of tasks "Small Library", that implements different approach
to solving concurrency of multiple threads (Readers)
to get the resource Library, by using :

	- synchronized block on Library object;
	
	- semaphore on Library critical operations;
	
A couple of library tasks are implemented in thread unsafe mode

	- Unsafe Library Task
	
	- Wish Book List Library Task
	
Also it has a solution for the Tunnel task (by using semaphore)
